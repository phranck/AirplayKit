/**
 The 3072-bit group from RFC 5054, which is the one HomeKit pairing uses.

 The modulus below is the value RFC 5054 prints in section 4, and it is the
 prime `2^3072 - 2^3008 - 1 + 2^64 * ([2^2942 pi] + 1690314)` that the same
 section names. Both were checked against each other rather than one being
 trusted: the printed digits were read out of the RFC and then recomputed from
 that closed form, and they agree.

 Everything a receiver pads is padded to the modulus's own length, which is 384
 bytes. That is what `padded` is for.
